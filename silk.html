            <h2 id="sub_title">LIFESPAN</h3>
            <p><strong>Everyday Use: </strong>Silk garments, such as blouses, dresses, or scarves, can last 1 to 3 years with regular use, especially if exposed to frequent washing, sunlight, and abrasion. However, with careful handling and proper maintenance, silk garments can last much longer.

                <strong>Occasional Use: </strong>Silk items that are worn or used occasionally, such as formal wear, ties, or evening gowns, can last 5 to 10 years or more when stored properly and handled delicately.
                
                <strong>Durability: </strong>While silk is strong for a natural fiber, it can be weakened by exposure to sunlight, perspiration, and chemicals (like bleach or harsh detergents). Silk items tend to maintain their beauty and integrity if kept away from these damaging elements.
                
                <strong>Vintage Silk: </strong>Well-preserved vintage silk textiles, such as traditional garments, scarves, or upholstery, can last decades, even up to 100 years or more, when stored in proper conditions (cool, dry, and dark environments).

            <h2 id="sub_title">MAINTAINENCE</h3>
                <p><strong>Washing: </strong>Hand washing silk in cold water is the best option. Use a mild detergent specifically designed for delicate fabrics, and avoid soaking silk for long periods, as it weakens the fibers. If machine washing, use a gentle cycle and place silk items in a mesh laundry bag. Avoid using bleach or harsh chemicals, as they can damage the silk.

                    <strong>Drying: </strong>Never wring or twist silk to remove water. Instead, gently blot excess water using a clean towel. Lay the item flat on a towel to air dry, preferably in a shaded area away from direct sunlight, which can fade and weaken the fabric.
                    
                    <strong>Ironing: </strong>Iron silk while it is still slightly damp using the lowest heat setting on the iron. Always place a cloth between the iron and the silk to prevent direct contact, which can scorch the fabric. Use steam to smooth out wrinkles gently.
                    
                    <strong>Storage: </strong>Store silk garments in a cool, dry place, away from sunlight. Avoid hanging silk for long periods, as it may stretch. Fold silk items with tissue paper to reduce creasing.
                    
                    <strong>Stain Removal: </strong>Address stains promptly by blotting (not rubbing) with cool water. For tough stains, consider professional dry cleaning.

            <h2 id="sub_title">ECOLOGICAL IMPACT</h2>
            <p><strong>Positive Impacts: </strong>

                <strong>Natural and Biodegradable: </strong>Silk is a natural protein fiber produced by silkworms. Unlike synthetic fabrics, it is biodegradable and can decompose in a few years under proper conditions, reducing landfill waste.
                
                <strong>Renewable Resource: </strong>Silk production relies on mulberry trees, which are easy to grow and help absorb carbon dioxide. This supports sustainable agriculture and contributes to lowering the carbon footprint.
                
                <strong>Low Chemical Use: </strong>Traditional silk farming (sericulture) often uses fewer pesticides and chemicals compared to cotton or synthetic fiber production. Organic silk, in particular, is produced with minimal environmental impact.
                
                <strong>Durability: </strong>Silk is a durable fabric when properly maintained. Its longevity can reduce the need for frequent replacements, helping to minimize textile waste.
                
                <strong>Negative Impacts: </strong>
                
                <strong>Resource Intensive: </strong>Silk production is labor-intensive and requires a large amount of water and energy to maintain mulberry crops, process cocoons, and manufacture textiles. This contributes to its high environmental footprint.
                
                <strong>Animal Welfare Concerns: </strong>Conventional silk production involves boiling silkworms alive to extract the fibers, raising ethical and environmental concerns. Alternative methods, such as Ahimsa (peace) silk, are less harmful but less widely used.
                
                <strong>Water Pollution: </strong>The degumming process (removal of sericin from silk fibers) and dyeing can lead to water pollution if not carefully managed, particularly when using synthetic dyes.</p>
