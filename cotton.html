            <p><strong>Everyday Clothing: </strong>High-quality cotton garments, such as t-shirts or jeans, can last 3 to 5 years with regular wear. They maintain their softness and breathability, making them comfortable for long-term use.
                
            <strong>Luxury Cotton:</strong> Items made from premium cotton, like Egyptian or Pima, have an even longer lifespan. With proper care, these pieces can stay in great condition for many years, providing you with comfort and style for longer.

            <h2 id="sub_title">MAINTAINENCE</h3>
                <p><strong>Washing:     </strong> Use cold or lukewarm water (30°C to 40°C) with a gentle detergent. Avoid bleach, as it can weaken fibers. Wash light and dark colors separately to prevent color bleeding.
                    
                    <strong>Drying:     </strong> Air drying is the best option to prevent shrinkage and preserve fiber strength. If using a dryer, opt for a low heat setting and remove garments while slightly damp to avoid over-drying.
                    
                    <strong>Ironing:        </strong> Use a medium heat setting or steam iron, and iron cotton while it is still slightly damp to remove wrinkles easily without damaging the fabric.
                    
                    </strong>Storage:       </strong> Store cotton garments in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight. Use breathable containers like cloth bags to prevent mildew and allow air circulation

            <h2 id="sub_title">ECOLOGICAL IMPACT</h2>
            <p><strong>Positive Impacts</strong>

            <strong>Biodegradability:</strong>
                Cotton is a natural fiber that decomposes over time without harming the environment. Unlike synthetic fibers, which contribute to long-lasting waste and microplastic pollution, cotton can be composted, reducing landfill burden.
                
            <strong>Renewable Resource:</strong>
                Cotton is a renewable resource, cultivated annually. This allows for sustainable agricultural practices and supports local economies, particularly in regions where cotton farming is vital for livelihood.
                
            <strong>Soil Health:</strong>
                With responsible management, cotton can contribute positively to soil health. Crop rotation and intercropping with cotton can enhance soil structure, prevent erosion, and increase biodiversity.
                
            <strong>Carbon Sequestration:</strong>
                Cotton plants absorb carbon dioxide through photosynthesis, helping to mitigate climate change. By sequestering carbon, cotton farming can play a role in reducing greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.
                
            <strong>Negative Impacts</strong>
        <strong> Water Usage:</strong>
                Cotton cultivation is water-intensive, requiring between 7,000 to 29,000 liters of water to produce just one kilogram. This can lead to water scarcity in regions where cotton is grown, stressing local resources.
                
            <strong> Chemical Use:</strong>
                Conventional cotton farming often relies on synthetic pesticides and fertilizers, which can pollute waterways and soil, harming ecosystems and posing health risks to communities.
                
            <strong>Biodiversity Loss:</strong>
                The prevalence of monoculture in cotton farming reduces biodiversity, making ecosystems more vulnerable to pests and diseases. This can lead to increased reliance on chemical interventions.</p>
