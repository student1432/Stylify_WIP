            <p>Linen textiles are known for their durability, typically lasting <strong>3 to 5 years</strong> with regular use and up to 10 years or more with proper care. Linen grows stronger and softer with each wash, unlike many other fabrics that weaken over time. Its fibers are two to three times stronger than cotton, contributing to its longevity. Linen items used less frequently can last for decades, while antique linen, when well-preserved, can endure for 100 years or more.

            <h2 id="sub_title">MAINTAINENCE</h3>
                <p><strong>Washing: </strong>Use cold or lukewarm water (30°C to 40°C) when washing linen to prevent shrinkage. Opt for a mild detergent to preserve the fibers, and avoid bleach, as it can weaken the fabric. Washing linen separately from other fabrics is advisable to prevent lint transfer.

                    <strong>Drying: </strong>Air drying is ideal for linen. Lay flat or hang to dry in a shaded area to maintain color and prevent weakening. If using a dryer, select a low heat setting and remove the items while still slightly damp to minimize wrinkles and shrinkage.
                    
                    <strong>Ironing: </strong>Iron linen while it is still slightly damp or use a steam iron on a medium setting. This helps to remove wrinkles effectively and maintain the fabric's crisp appearance.
                    
                    <strong>Storage: </strong>Store linen in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight. Use breathable storage options like cotton bags to avoid mildew.

            <h2 id="sub_title">ECOLOGICAL IMPACT</h2>
            <p><strong>Positive Impacts</strong>

                <strong>Sustainable Crop: </strong>Flax, from which linen is made, requires less water than cotton and often grows well in poor soil, making it an environmentally friendly choice.
                
                <strong>Reduced Chemical Use: </strong>Flax is naturally resistant to pests, minimizing the need for synthetic pesticides and herbicides. This reduces chemical runoff and promotes healthier ecosystems.
                
                <strong>Biodegradability: </strong>Linen is biodegradable and compostable, breaking down within a few years, which helps reduce landfill waste compared to synthetic fibers.
                
                <strong>Lower Carbon Footprint: </strong>The production of linen generally emits fewer greenhouse gases compared to synthetic textiles, especially when produced using sustainable farming practices.
                
                <strong>Waste Utilization: </strong>Byproducts of flax processing, such as seeds and stalks, can be repurposed for animal feed or biofuel, contributing to a circular economy.
                
                <strong>Negative Impacts</strong>
                
                <strong>Water Pollution: </strong>Although flax requires less water, the processing of linen can involve chemical treatments that may lead to water pollution if not managed properly.
                
                <strong>Energy Consumption: </strong>The energy required for processing and finishing linen fabrics can contribute to carbon emissions, particularly if fossil fuels are used.
                
                <strong>Labor Conditions: </strong>Linen production may involve labor-intensive practices, and poor working conditions can be a concern in some regions where flax is cultivated.
                
                <strong>Limited Availability: </strong>While linen is sustainable, the production volume is lower than that of cotton, which may lead to higher prices and limited access in some markets.
                
                <strong>Allergies: </strong>Some individuals may be sensitive or allergic to linen fibers, which can limit its usability for certain consumers.</p>
