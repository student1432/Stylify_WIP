            <h2 id="sub_title">LIFESPAN</h3>
            <p><strong>Everyday Use: </strong>Polyester garments, such as clothing and activewear, typically last 3 to 5 years with regular use. With proper care, including washing in cold water and air drying, polyester items can last up to 7 to 10 years or longer.

                <strong>Durability: </strong>Polyester fibers are strong, resistant to stretching, and maintain their shape well, which contributes to their longevity. They are also resistant to wrinkles, mildew, and fading, making them a popular choice for various applications.
                
                <strong>Occasional Use: </strong>Items like polyester tablecloths, curtains, or sports gear, when used less frequently, can last for decades if properly maintained.
                
                <strong>Recycling Potential: </strong>While polyester is a synthetic fiber, it can be recycled into new polyester products. This recycling process helps to extend the lifecycle of polyester textiles and reduces waste.
                
                <strong>Environmental Impact: </strong>Despite its longevity, polyester's non-biodegradability poses environmental concerns, as it can take hundreds of years to decompose in landfills.

            <h2 id="sub_title">MAINTAINENCE</h3>
                <p><strong>Washing: </strong>Use cold water for washing polyester to prevent shrinkage and fading. A mild detergent is recommended, and it’s best to avoid bleach, which can damage the fibers. Wash polyester items inside out to minimize friction and wear on the fabric surface.

                    <strong>Drying: </strong>drying is preferable, as it helps retain the fabric’s shape and prevents heat damage. If using a dryer, select a low heat setting and remove items promptly to minimize wrinkles. Over-drying can lead to static cling and damage the fibers.
                    
                    <strong>Ironing: </strong>If necessary, iron polyester on a low heat setting or use a steam iron to remove wrinkles. Always check the care label, as some polyester blends may require different heat settings. Avoid high temperatures, which can melt the fibers.
                    
                    <strong>Storage: </strong>Store polyester garments in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight to prevent fading. Use breathable garment bags for longer-term storage to protect against dust and moisture.
                    
                    <strong>Stain Removal: </strong>Treat stains promptly with mild soap and water. Avoid harsh chemicals, which can damage the fabric.

            <h2 id="sub_title">ECOLOGICAL IMPACT</h2>
            <p><strong>Negative Impacts: </strong>

                <strong>Non-Biodegradability: </strong>Polyester is not biodegradable, taking hundreds of years to decompose in landfills. This contributes to significant environmental waste, especially as fast fashion increases polyester production.
                
                <strong>Microplastic Pollution: </strong>Washing polyester fabrics releases microplastics into waterways. These tiny plastic particles can harm marine life and enter the food chain, posing risks to ecosystems and human health.
                
                <strong>Resource Intensive: </strong>The production of polyester requires significant amounts of water and energy, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions. It relies on fossil fuels, which contribute to environmental degradation and climate change.
                
                <strong>Chemical Use: </strong>The manufacturing process involves the use of chemicals that can pollute air and water if not managed properly. This can lead to adverse effects on local communities and ecosystems.
                
                <strong>Positive Impacts: </strong>
                
                <strong>Recyclability: </strong>Polyester can be recycled into new polyester products, reducing the need for virgin materials. Recycled polyester (rPET) helps to mitigate some environmental impacts by decreasing waste and resource consumption.
                
                <strong>Durability: </strong>Polyester is strong and long-lasting, reducing the frequency of replacement compared to natural fibers. This longevity can lead to less waste over time when properly maintained.</p>
